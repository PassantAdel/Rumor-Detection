# Rumor Detection Model on Twitter

## Overview:
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of detecting rumors on Twitter. The model was developed using Python, and the Random Forest algorithm was selected for its balance between accuracy and interpretability.

---------------------------------
## Steps Involved:
1. Data Collection:
The dataset was gathered from various Twitter sources, including both rumor and non-rumor tweets.

2. Data Preprocessing:
I independently handled data preprocessing to ensure the dataset was clean and suitable for training. This involved:
Handling missing data.
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant information.
- Tokenizing and normalizing the text data.
- Removing stop words and applying stemming/lemmatization.
